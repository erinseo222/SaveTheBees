                    <p>Hornsby Girls High School is an exciting place to learn!</p>
                    <p>Students love coming to our school. It is a vibrant place of teaching and learning.</p>
                    <p>The school curriculum has been developed to ensure that Quality Teaching and Learning is at the
                        forefront of everything we do.</p>
                    <p>Our Gifted and Talented programs enable our students to develop their potential and to pursue
                        their creativity and critical thinking which operates in every class each day.</p>
                    Our Student Wellbeing programs enable our girls to be fully supported in their learning through the
                    use of positive philosophies
                    which underpin all student activities. These proactive student wellbeing programs meet the specific
                    needs of our Gifted and Talented girls.</p>
                    <p>The school places a strong emphasis on holistic learning and student leadership.
                        This ensures that our girls develop into confident young women fully ready to take their place
                        as leaders within their communities in academics, culture and sports.</p>

                    <h1 id="how">HOW WE WORK</h1>
                    <p>In a school such as Hornsby Girls High, all our students are gifted academically, and many of
                        them are also multi-talented young women in the Creative and Performing Arts,
                        in Sport, in School and Community Service activities, and in Leadership roles.</p>
                    <p>There are many co-curricular and extra-curricular activities in which our students may become
                        involved to enrich their enjoyment of school life.
                        All the students are encouraged to participate, and it is sometimes a very difficult task for
                        the school to try and spread the leadership responsibilities across a range of students and a
                        range of years.</p>
                    <p>There are many natural leaders at HGHS. What follows are lists of current student leadership
                        across various roles. We hope it will encourage even more students to seek such positions at
                        this great school.</p>
