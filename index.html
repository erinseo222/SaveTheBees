                    <p>Bees are insects with wings closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila.</p>

                                <p>There are about 20,000 different species of bees in the world. Bees live in colonies that contain the queen bee, the worker bee and the drone. The worker bee and the queen bee are both female, but only the queen bee can reproduce. All drones are male. Worker bees clean the hive, collecting pollen and nectar to feed the colony and they take care of the offspring. The drone’s only job is to mate with the queen. The queen’s only job is to lay eggs.</p>
                                <p>Bees store their venom in a sac attached to their stinger and only female bees sting. That is because the stinger, called an ovipositor, is part of the female bee’s reproductive design. A queen bee uses her ovipositor to lay eggs as well as sting. Sterile females, also called worker bees, don’t lay eggs. They just use their ovipositors to sting.</p>

                            Bees are keystone species. They play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and ecosystem health and without them, many ecosystems would be altered or cease to exist altogether.

                        <p>Bees are so important to our livelihood as they help to pollinate most of the crops we eat and many that feed farm livestock. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Australia’s agricultural production benefits from bee pollination. Honey bees are the most widespread managed pollinator having co-evolved with our food production systems. Without bees, our food security is at risk. That’s why food security needs bee security. There are over 20,000 species of bee that exist globally and Australia is home to around 2,000 species of native bee. These bees have co-evolved with our unique native flora over thousands of years.

                        Bee populations are under threat. Destruction of their natural habitat, intensive farming practices, and pests and diseases are just some of the complex reasons driving a decline in both  the number and diversity of bees.

                                <h3>HABITAT LOSS</h3>
                                <p>Another major reason for the bees’ extinction is their habitat loss.  Humans have a major role in this cause. For example, humans’ need to expand their city or extend a community of houses will need construction and natural resources. This could mean the cutting down of trees and trees are honeybee’s habitat.</p>

                                <p>The two main types of parasites that are harming the honeybees are tracheal and varroa mites. Tracheal mites live internally in the honeybee and kills them. The varroa mites live externally in the beehive and affect the young bees that are being raised.This is a problem that has not been solved.</p>

                                <p>Bees are highly attracted to electromagnetic radiation. When a cell phone is used it projects electromagnetic waves and it damages bees’ ability to return to their colony. It is as if their navigation system is destroyed and they cannot recall where their home is. Phones not good for bees.</p>
